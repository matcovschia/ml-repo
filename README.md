Personal ML projects
For now many of these projects are simply follow-alongs of book material as I attempt to learn machine-learning. But in the future there will be some personal projects where I test out my understanding on common datasets(regression and titanic, classification and iris). 

I may also migrate some of my kaggle notebooks to my personal repo and push them, but that is tbd as of now.
